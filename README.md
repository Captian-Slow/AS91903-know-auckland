This repository is for my 'know auckland' website, created for NZQA Digital Technologies Achievement Standard 91903. 

At the time of committing all the files, 
some version control had already been done -- the HTML files were on their 3rd version, 
and the CSS file was on  its 2nd version. 

This was because I neglected to start using GitHub and committing to it the moment I started coding.
